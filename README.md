* **Configurable:**  Fine-tune wear rates, repair costs, visual effects, and more to tailor the system to your server's needs.
* **Framework Support:**  Seamless integration with both QBCore and ESX frameworks, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of servers.
* **Mechanic Integration:**  Easily tie into your existing mechanic jobs, allowing players to earn money by repairing other players' vehicles.
